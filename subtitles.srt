1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:02,053
Yaar coding is changing, right?

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:04,193
Actually AI is the future, see.

3
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:06,883
You know, it's basically automating tasks, na?

4
00:00:07,183 --> 00:00:08,713
Tell me, who wouldn't want that?

5
00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:12,013
AI assists coders, making it faster, you know.

6
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:15,933
It's like AI writes code and humans review, basically.

7
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:20,083
Practical examples like GitHub's co-pilot are already here, yaar.

8
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,373
It's transforming the industry actually.

The impact is huge, see.

10
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:27,843
As it increases efficiency and reduces errors, right?

11
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:31,063
So the future of coding with AI is exciting, na?

12
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,673
And it's changing the way we work, basically.

13
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:36,003
