Here is a high-fidelity visual animation storyboard for the 60-second technical reel:
Animate a revolving 3D CPU icon with data pulse lines, transitioning into a swarm of miniature robotic arms assembling a circuit board. 
As "AI" text appears, morph the circuit board into a neural network diagram with glowing blue synapses. 
A spinning globe icon emerges, surrounded by code snippets and server icons, highlighting AI's global reach and computational power. 
A stylized robot arm holds a pencil, scribbling equations on a digital blackboard, symbolizing AI's assistive capabilities in schoolwork and daily tasks. 
Finally, a pulsing lightbulb icon explodes into a kaleidoscope of connected gears, representing AI's potential to change lives for the better.
