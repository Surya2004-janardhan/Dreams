Here is a 60-second visual animation storyboard for the technical reel:
Animate a swirling vortex of code symbols, transitioning into a robotic arm icon with glowing blue circuits, as the script introduces AI in 2026. 
Morph the robotic arm into a stethoscope icon with a pulsing ECG waveform, highlighting AI's role in medical diagnosis, such as disease detection.
Transition to a self-driving car icon with spinning wheels and a navigation map, illustrating AI-assisted transportation, as the script mentions self-driving cars.
Dissolve the car icon into a network of interconnected nodes with flashing neon lines, symbolizing AI's potential to enhance our lives and make them smarter. 
Conclude with a rotating 3D brain icon surrounded by orbiting code fragments, emphasizing AI as a powerful tool that complements human intelligence.
