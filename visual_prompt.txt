Here's a high-fidelity visual animation storyboard for a 60-second technical reel on Caching Strategy:
Animate a flashing speedometer icon with a rocket ship, transitioning into a database symbol with a clock, highlighting "Fast Data".
A revolving 3D CPU icon with data pulse lines morphs into a cache memory chip icon, labeled "Cache".
Frequently-used file icons (e.g., images, documents) stream into a folder labeled "Frequent", with a glowing green checkmark.
A slow database query symbol (e.g., a snail) transforms into a speedy one (e.g., a cheetah), with a "Boost" label and ascending performance graph.
A final animated gauge fills up with a "Performance" label, as a series of tiny, pulsing server icons flash in the background, representing " Savings" and "Time".
