00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
Hey, Raj, can you tell me about machine learning?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,960
I've been wondering, yaar. What's the big deal about it,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
yaar? Machine learning is actually quite interesting.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,920
See, basically, it's a type of artificial intelligence that

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,720
helps systems learn from data, right? You know, like how we learn

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,480
from our experiences. ML algorithms learn from the data they're

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,360
trained on. Oh, really? But how does it work exactly?

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,720
Tell me now, is it like super complicated or something?

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,520
No, yaar, it's not that complicated, actually.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,660
You know, ML algorithms can be broadly classified into supervised,

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,980
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. See,

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,820
supervised learning is like learning from labeled data.

13
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,580
Unsupervised is like finding patterns in unlabeled data.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,060
And reinforcement learning is like learning from trial and error.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,020
Right. It's used in many applications like image recognition,

16
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
natural language processing, and more.
