  //   const prompt = `Write a natural conversation in pure Indian English between Rani (curious girl) and Raj (knowledgeable guy) about: ${topic}

  // ${description ? `Context: ${description}` : ""}

  // Tone & Style:
  // - Use casual Indian English with fillers like "yaar", "actually", "you know", "see", "basically", "right?", "no yaar", "tell me na"
  // - Conversation should sound natural, like two friends talking
  // - Rani asks short, curious questions with Indian English fillers
  // - Raj gives clear, detailed explanations but in a friendly conversational way
  // - Avoid robotic or formal tone; keep it flowing like real dialogue
  // - Maximum 2‚Äì3 exchanges to fit time
  // - Total must be 110‚Äì120 words (count every single word, including fillers)

  // Format Example:
  // Rani: Hey, can you tell me about [topic]? I've been wondering...
  // Raj: Yaar, [topic] is actually quite interesting. See, basically...
  // Rani: Oh really? But how does it work exactly?
  // Raj: No yaar, let me explain properly. You know...

  // CRITICAL RULES:
  // - Strictly 110‚Äì120 words only
  // - Must be short enough for ~70 seconds speech
  // - Cover the key technical points with clarity, not surface-level
  // - Keep it natural, engaging, and educational in tone`;
  const prompt = `Write a dialogue in Indian English between Raj and Rani on: ${topic}

${description ? `Context: ${description}` : ""}

Guidelines:
- Rani: very short, curious questions only (1‚Äì2 lines each, max 10 words).
- Raj: detailed, clear, friendly answers (bulk of word count).
- Style: casual Indian English with natural fillers ("yaar", "actually", "see", "you know", "right?", "na").
- Keep flow like two friends chatting, not robotic.
- 2‚Äì3 exchanges only.
- Strictly 120‚Äì130 words total.
- Cover deeper, essential technical points (avoid surface-level talk).
- Output ONLY dialogue lines, no extra comments or thanks.

Format Example:
Rani: Yaar, can you tell me about [topic]?
Raj: Actually, see... [detailed explanation]`;
