  const prompt = `Create a natural, engaging conversation in pure Indian English between Rani (curious female questioner) and Raj (knowledgeable male expert) about: ${topic}

${description ? `Context: ${description}` : ""}

Style Requirements:
- Pure Indian English with natural expressions like "yaar", "actually", "you know", "see", "basically", "right?", "no yaar", "tell me na"
- Sound like real people talking casually, not formal or robotic
- Rani asks short, natural questions with Indian English fillers
- Raj explains in detail but conversationally, using Indian English phrases
- Keep it flowing naturally like a real discussion, not structured Q&A
- Total speaking time: EXACTLY 70 seconds when spoken at normal pace
- Make explanations comprehensive but concise to fit 70 seconds
- Include 2-3 exchanges maximum to stay within time limit

Format naturally like this:
Rani: Hey, can you tell me about [topic]? I've been wondering...
Raj: Yaar, [topic] is actually quite interesting. See, basically...
Rani: Oh really? But how does it work exactly?
Raj: No yaar, let me explain properly. You know...

Topic: ${topic}

IMPORTANT: Keep total content short enough to be spoken in exactly 70 seconds. Focus on key points with natural Indian English expressions.`;
