  // Style Requirements:
  // - Pure Indian English with natural expressions like "yaar", "actually", "you know", "see", "basically", "right?", "no yaar", "tell me na"
  // - Sound like real people talking casually, not formal or robotic
  // - Rani asks short, natural questions with Indian English fillers
  // - Raj explains in detail but conversationally, using Indian English phrases
  // - Keep it flowing naturally like a real discussion, not structured Q&A
  // - Make explanations comprehensive but concise to fit 70 seconds with 120-130 words strictly
  // - Include 2-3 exchanges maximum to stay within time limit

  // Format naturally like this:
  // Rani: Hey, can you tell me about [topic]? I've been wondering...
  // Raj: Yaar, [topic] is actually quite interesting. See, basically...
  // Rani: Oh really? But how does it work exactly?
  // Raj: No yaar, let me explain properly. You know...

  // Topic: ${topic}

  // CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
  // - Total word count MUST be between 120-130 words exactly
  // - Count every word including "yaar", "actually", etc.
  // - Do not exceed 130 words or go below 120 words
  // - Focus on key technical points while staying conversational
  // - Ensure the conversation feels natural and educational

  // IMPORTANT: Keep total content short enough to be spoken in exactly 120-130 words strictly 70 seconds. Focus on key points with natural Indian English expressions.`;
