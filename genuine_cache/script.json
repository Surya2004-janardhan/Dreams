  "script": "Actually yaar, let me explain about artificial intelligence. See, AI is basically a technology that allows machines to learn and make decisions like humans. You know, it uses algorithms and huge amounts of data to recognize patterns and solve problems. Right now, we're seeing AI in self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, and even creative tasks like writing and art. Na, the real power comes from machine learning and deep neural networks that can process information in ways we never thought possible. It's using techniques like neural Darwinism and backpropagation to improve itself. Tell me, it's transforming everything from healthcare to education! The future is exciting, yaar, and AI is going to be a key player.",
